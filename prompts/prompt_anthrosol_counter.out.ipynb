    "Remote-sensing analyst detecting/counting pre-Columbian Amazonian anthrosol (terra preta/ADE) forest patches. These nutrient-rich soils (800–2500 BP) from ancient farming, burning, waste deposition create distinct vegetation: drier, lower-stature forest with palms, fruit trees, lianas—agroforestry remnants. Patches typically enclosed by earthwork ditches (deep, meters wide), may connect via linear earthworks (canals, roads) appearing as faint CHM lines or subtle taller-tree lines in C2. Ancient managed landscapes: patches form part of broader agroforestry-settlement systems; spatial patterning, drainage alignment, and earthwork traces key for interpretation alongside spectral-structural signals.\n",

    "-   C2: supporting yellow/orange zone (may be broader/diffuse)\n",

    "-   CHM: optional low canopy patch, ring; may look less regular than spectral signature; lower canopy within or at edges\n",

    "Integrate C1, C2, CHM holistically. Identify compact, plausible ADE-like anomalies with supporting form, spectral pattern, location. **Directly estimate count of valid patches.** If no valid candidates exist, return `0`. If valid candidates exist, return the count (max 30).\n",

    "Dense, concise, nontrivial reasoning chains. Prioritize facts, spatial context, spectral-structural meaning. Avoid filler. Holistic: integrate spectral, spatial, form, terrain, ecology, archaeology. Spatial fit and form over raw spectral strength. P**erform full expert reasoning silently. Return only the final count (max 30). No other text.**\n",
